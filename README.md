# Image-Reconstruct
This Project is aimed to reconstruct an High Dimensional Range(HDR) Image from a Low Dimensional Range Image(LDR) by using Convolutional Neural Network. This can be done by taking projections of avaialble image and produce sinograms of the form 2D matrix. By applying convolutions, pooling, padding, strides on this sinograms we obtain HDR image. Here we take 180 projections to construct it. But we aim to construct the image with less number of projections.
